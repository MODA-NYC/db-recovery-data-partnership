## About

![data partners](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/analytics/images/content/pages/partners.png)

The NYC Recovery Data Partnership (RDP) is a first-of-its-kind effort for community, non-profit, and private organizations to share data with the City to aid in Covid-19 response and recovery efforts. Data shared by partner organizations is provided free-of-charge to bolster understanding of how industry, service delivery, and the lived experiences of New Yorkers have been impacted by Covid-19, and will help to inform programmatic and policy decisions for an equitable recovery.

The Recovery Data Partnership is chaired by the Mayor's Office of Policy and Planning, the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics, and the Mayor's Office of Operations, with counsel from the City's Chief Privacy Officer and is centered on principles of privacy, fairness, accountability, and transparency.

- Frequently updated and standardized data, as opposed to static or snapshots

## Guiding Principles of the Partnership

The City has designed this partnership with New Yorkers and the following principles in mind:

Equity and Fairness: The City aims to seek and use representative data of the lived experiences of New Yorkers from all backgrounds and geographies to inform efforts for an equitable recovery.
Transparency and Accountability: The Recovery Data Partnership team will review all proposed City uses of data provided by partners, and information about data uses will be made publicly available for New Yorkers to see how data is being used through analysis. Partnership advisors will have an opportunity to contribute their ideas and expertise as part of the City's review process.
Privacy: The City takes protecting and being a custodian of New Yorkers' information very seriously. All partners have agreed to adhere to City privacy and confidentiality guidelines, and the City will restrict data access to agencies and analysts with approved Covid-19-related use cases.
